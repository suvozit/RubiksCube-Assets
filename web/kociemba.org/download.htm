    <td valign="top" width="700" bgcolor="#E7E9FA" height="280"><p>I also have a special version <font color="#FF0000">Cube Explorer 5.00s</font> available, which uses more than 2 GB of RAM for the huge optimal solver 
  tables. It is about 15 times faster than the standard optimal solver and <strong>optimally</strong> solves a random cube in <strong>less than two 
    minutes</strong> on average on a 3 GHz Pentium 4 machine.</p>
<p>With a 32 bit operating system, only Windows XP Professional supports a 
  virtual address space of more than 2 GB for an application. Even with 
  these versions you have to use the /3GB switch in the Boot.ini file to 
  support more than 2 GB of RAM for an application (see <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/whdc/system/platform/server/PAE/PAEmem.mspx">here</a> for details).<br>
You may download this special 
  version <a href="http://kociemba.org/cube500s.zip">here</a>.</p>
<p>If you run Windows Vista 64 bit, this version will run without any 
problems if you have about 4 GB of RAM installed. With an Intel Core i7 
920 CPU I solved about 300 cubes optimally within one hour by doing the 
computations in parallel to keep all 8 cores (4 physical and 4 virtual 
cores) busy.</p>

        interested in an <strong>Optimal Cube Solver in the Quarter Turn Metric</strong> 
        which runs on the command line under <strong>LINUX</strong> and <strong>WINDOWS</strong>, 
        you can download the documented <strong>C source code</strong> <a href="http://kociemba.org/optiqtmSrc.zip">here</a>. 
        An already compiled version for Windows is available <a href="http://kociemba.org/optiqtmWinExe.zip">here</a>. 
        The program also accepts the file format of Cube Explorer, so you can 
        generate your cubes in Cube Explorer and feed them to this program.<br>
        Bruce MacKenzie has ported this command line program to run on a<strong> 
        MAC</strong> (nomen est omen). You can download the program <a href="http://kociemba.org/macsolver.zip">here</a>.</p>

   <tr><td valign="top" width="700" bgcolor="#E7E9FA" height="60"> <p>A working version of the two-phase-algorithm is not too easy to program. For demonstration purposes I wrote a <span class="style1">Java package</span> which implements the two-phase-algorithm in its simplest form without any symmetry reductions.</p>
     <p>The package org.kociemba.twophase, the sourcecode and the corresponding javadocs are included in the file <a href="http://kociemba.org/twophase.jar">twophase.jar</a> . The little Java program <a href="http://kociemba.org/GUI_example.jar">GUI_example.jar</a> (Version 2009.02.16), which is an executable jar file shows an example how to use the package. </p>
     <p>The tables in this implementation take only about 5 MB and are 
generated within seconds. Nevertheless the package routine solved about 
26000 random cubes/hour if the maximum maneuver length was set to 21 
moves and about 800 random cubes/hour if it was set to 20 moves maximum 
length.</p>
     <p>You may use this package for free but you must include an appropriate credit line.</p></td>

The code runs very slow, but it is also very short. It might be interesting from a theoretical point of view.</p>
    <p>The interactive editor function in the package needs at least Version 6.0 of Mathematica.</p></td>
