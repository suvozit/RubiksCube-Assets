First place goes to Tomas Sirgedas, from Ann Arbor, Michigan, with an
absolutely amazing implementation of Thistlethwaite's algorithm in only
874 characters of C++!  For my data set, he averaged 16.03 moves per
solution, and his program ran in an average of 64 milliseconds per solve.
His overall score is an incredible 7,901;
<a href="http://tomas.rokicki.com/cubecontest/tomas.txt">this program</a> must be seen to be believed.
<p>
Judge's prize goes to Stefan Pochmann of Darmstadt, Germany, for his
implementation of Thistlethwaite's algorithm in C++.  He had the
second-lowest score of 15,278 with a program that weighed in at
1311 characters, took 197 milliseconds a solution, and averaged 16.72
moves per cube.  And if <a href="http://tomas.rokicki.com/cubecontest/stefan1.txt">that program</a>
weren't good enough he probably would have won the Judge's prize
anyway, for the <a href="http://tomas.rokicki.com/cubecontest/stefan2.txt">overall shortest submission</a>
at 528 characters of Perl, taking 15 milliseconds per solution, and
averaging 327.63 moves per cube.
</p><p>
Third prize goes to Jaap Scherphuis of Delft, the Netherlands, for
his implementation of Thistlethwaite's algorithm in (once again)
C++.   <a href="http://tomas.rokicki.com/cubecontest/jaap.txt">His program</a> was 2059 characters long,
took an average of 154 milliseconds per solve, and yielded solutions
averaging 16.04 moves long, for a total score of 21,599.  Furthermore,
both the first and second place winners credit Jaap and his site for
help with the algorithms!
</p><p>
Fourth prize goes to Antony Boucher of Gennevilliers, France, who
solved the cube with four successive IDA* searches to solve the
whole cross up to a particular depth, then if that failed, the top cross,
then the rest of the edges, then the corners using a set of predefined
algorithms.  <a href="http://tomas.rokicki.com/cubecontest/boucher.txt">His code</a> in C came in at 1628
characters, took an amazingly low 22 milliseconds per solution,
averaged 29.49 moves over my data set, and ended up with a score of 25,061.
</p><p>
The <a href="http://tomas.rokicki.com/cubecontest/testdata.txt">data set</a> I used included all single-move positions, 18 two-move
positions, 18 three-move positions, and 46 random positions.
