<a name="introduction"></a><h6><img src="rubikscubesolution_files/LittleCube.jpg" alt="Rubik's Cube" width="20" align="absmiddle" border="0" height="22"> Introduction</h6>
<p>There are many different methods for solving the Rubik's cube. They 
can be divided into two broad categories: layer methods and corners 
first methods (and there are sub-categories within these broad 
categories). The method I use for speedsolving 
is a layer based method. More specifically, the method I currently use 
is: 
cross, F2L, 3-look LL (I know some of the OLLs, so sometimes I can do a 
2-look 
LL). If you are a newbie cuber then this description may not mean much 
to you, so I should add that it's the 'Advanced Solution' I described in
 the <a href="#next-steps"><b>Next Steps</b></a> section at the end of this page.
</p><p>Many years ago when I wrote this webpage there were many great 
websites that explained advanced and expert methods for solving the cube
 (check out my <a href="http://peter.stillhq.com/jasmine/Cube/rubikslinks.html"><b>Rubiks links</b></a>
 page), 
however, there were very few that explained beginner methods. This is 
the reason 
I wrote this page. It's not meant to be a totally comprehensive 
explanation, it's really just some notes I threw together for some 
friends I was teaching. I thought it might be useful for others, so I've
 turned it into a webpage. 
</p><p>This beginner method requires memorising only a few algorithms, 
and when done efficiently can achieve solves of 60 seconds or faster. I 
know people who can solve in 
20-30s with a method like this. I 
haven't been able to solve so fast with a beginner method, so don't be 
too distressed if you can't either. On the other hand, if you can do 30s
 solves with this method, then you are too good for this method and you 
should be learning an Advanced 
or Expert method!
</p><p>Aside from minimal memorisation, another benefit of this method is that it is 
very scalable. More algorithms may be added later to develop it into an advanced 
method, or if you're really keen, an expert method. This means you don't need to 
scrap it and start again to move to an expert method. Everything you learn here 
will be useful for more advanced methods.

<a name="structure"></a></p><h6><img src="rubikscubesolution_files/LittleCube.jpg" alt="Rubik's Cube" width="20" align="absmiddle" border="0" height="22"> Structure of the cube</h6>
<p>We all know that 3x3x3=27, however, rather than thinking about the 
cube as 27 little "cubies", think about it as 6 fixed centres (that can 
rotate on their own axis) with 8 corners and 12 edges which rotate 
around it. As the centres are fixed, the centre colour defines the 
colour for the face. It's important to remember this otherwise you'll 
end up trying to do illogical (mechanically impossible!) things like 
wondering why you can't work out how to put a corner piece in an edge 
position, or assuming that you're looking at the blue face merely 
because 8 of the 9 cubies on it are blue (if the centre is white then 
it's the white face).

<a name="terminology"></a></p><h6><img src="rubikscubesolution_files/LittleCube.jpg" alt="Rubik's Cube" width="20" align="absmiddle" border="0" height="22"> Terminology</h6>
<p>When describing the solution for the 2nd and 3rd layers, standard 
cube notation will be used. Here's what you need to know to read it:
</p><p>
<table width="90%" align="center"><tbody><tr>
<td><p><b>F</b> = front face</p></td>
<td><p><b>B</b> = back face</p></td>
<td><p><b>R</b> = right face</p></td>
<td><p><b>L</b> = left face</p></td>
<td><p><b>U</b> = up face</p></td>
<td><p><b>D</b> = down face</p></td>
</tr></tbody></table>

</p><p>In addition to a letter, each move may be accompanied by an apostrophe or the number two:</p><ul>
	<li>A letter by itself means turn that face 90 degrees clockwise (eg. <b>F</b>).</li>
	<li>A letter followed by an apostrophe means turn that face 90 degrees anti-clockwise (eg.
	<b>F'</b>).</li>
	<li>A letter followed by the number 2 means turn that face 180 degrees (direction is irrelevant), (eg.
	<b>F2</b>).

</li>
	</ul>

<p>So <b>R U' L2</b> is shorthand for <i>"turn the right face 90 degrees clockwise, then turn the up face 90 degrees anti-clockwise, then turn the left face 180 degrees"</i>.
 When thinking whether to turn clockwise/anti-clockwise, imagine that 
you are looking directly at the particular face you are turning.

</p><p>For each algorithm, the notation is written with the assumption 
that the core of the cube remains fixed throughout the whole algorithm, 
and the faces just turn around it. This means that you also need to know
 how to position the cube to start the algorithm.

<a name="solution"></a></p><center><h3>The Solution</h3></center>

<!-- FIRST LAYER -->

<a name="first-layer"></a><h4><img src="rubikscubesolution_files/LittleCube.jpg" alt="Rubik's Cube" width="20" align="absmiddle" border="0" height="22"> The First Layer</h4>

<p>The first layer is solved in two stages:</p><ol>
	<li>Form the cross</li>
	<li>Insert the 4 first layer corners (each corner is inserted individually)
	</li>
	</ol>
<p>I believe that the first layer should be done intuitively. You need 
to understand it and solve it without learning algorithms. Until you can
 do this, I wouldn't bother attempting the rest of the cube! So, spend 
some time playing with the cube and familiarising yourself with how to 
move the pieces around the cube.
</p><p>Now, here are some tips to get you started.

<!-- CROSS -->

<a name="cross"></a></p><h6><img src="rubikscubesolution_files/LittleCube.jpg" alt="Rubik's Cube" width="20" align="absmiddle" border="0" height="22"> The Cross</h6>

<p>I prefer to start with the white cross because I find white easier to
 quickly identify on a completely scrambled cube, however, you can use 
any colour.

</p><p>There are 4 edge pieces with white (ie. the 4 arms of the cross) 
which have specific positions. You can't put any white edge piece in an 
arm of the cross because the other colour on the edge cubie must match 
up with it's centre on the middle layer.

<img src="rubikscubesolution_files/cross-correct.gif" alt="cross: correct" width="89" border="0" height="98">
<p>Here is a pic of what a correctly formed cross looks like (grey denotes cubies that are irrelevant to the cross). Note that the <b>white</b>/<font color="#FF0000"><b>red</b></font> edge cubie matches up with the <b>white</b> centre and the <font color="#FF0000"><b>red</b></font> centre. Ditto re the <b>white</b>/<font color="#0000FF"><b>blue</b></font> cubie.</p></center></td>

Ditto re the <b>white</b>/<font color="#0000FF"><b>blue</b></font> cubie. This is bad!</p></center></td>

<!-- FIRST LAYER CORNERS -->

<a name="FL-corners"></a></p><h6><img src="rubikscubesolution_files/LittleCube.jpg" alt="Rubik's Cube" width="20" align="absmiddle" border="0" height="22"> The First Layer Corners</h6>
<p>Once you have completed the cross, completing the first layer 
requires inserting each of the 4 corners in separately. The first thing 
to do is examine your cube and locate all of the top layer edge pieces -
 they will be sitting in either the 
first layer or the last layer. Inserting the first layer corners should 
be done intuitively, not by learning algorithms. To get you started, 
here's a step-by-step example of one way to insert a 
first layer corner.
</p><p>
<table width="100%" cellspacing="10"><tbody><tr>
<td valign="top" width="25%"><center><img src="rubikscubesolution_files/FLC1.jpg" alt="first layer corner: step 1" width="89" border="0" height="98"><p><b>Step 1</b>
</p><p>The <font color="#0000FF"><b>blue</b></font>/<font color="#FF0000"><b>red</b></font>/<b>white</b> corner is sitting in the bottom layer (the <font color="#0000FF"><b>blue</b></font> part is facing the bottom so we can't see it in this picture). Turn the <font color="#0000FF"><b>blue</b></font> face 90 degrees anti-clockwise.
</p></center></td>
<td valign="top" width="25%"><center><img src="rubikscubesolution_files/FLC2.jpg" alt="first layer corner: step 2" width="89" border="0" height="98"><p><b>Step 2</b>
</p><p>Now your cube should look like this. Move the D face 90 degrees anti-clockwise to line up the <font color="#0000FF"><b>blue</b></font>/<b>white</b> edge with the <font color="#0000FF"><b>blue</b></font>/<b>white</b>/<font color="#FF0000"><b>red</b></font> corner.
</p></center></td>
<td valign="top" width="25%"><center><img src="rubikscubesolution_files/FLC3.jpg" alt="first layer corner: step 3" width="89" border="0" height="98"><p><b>Step 3</b>

</p></center></td>
<td valign="top" width="25%"><center><img src="rubikscubesolution_files/FLC4.jpg" alt="first layer corner: step 4" width="89" border="0" height="98"><p><b>Step 4</b>
</p><p>Now the <font color="#0000FF"><b>blue</b></font>/<b>white</b>/<font color="#FF0000"><b>red</b></font> corner is in its correct place.
</p></center></td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
</p><p>
</p><p><i>Here are some tips for inserting the top layer corners:</i>
</p><ul>
<li><p>Start with a first layer corner that is sitting in the last layer.</p></li>
<li><p>If there are multiple first layer corners in the last layer 
(there usually will be), start with one that does not have the white 
part of the corner on the face 
opposite the white face. Or, if you were using a different colour for 
the cross ('colour X'), start with a corner that does not have the 
'colour X' part of the corner on the face 
opposite the 'colour X' face.</p></li>
<li><p>When working with a first layer corner piece that is in the first
 layer (but in the wrong 
first layer corner position), you will need to get it out of the first 
layer into the 
last layer, then insert it into the correct first layer corner position.
 The same principle applies if a 
first layer corner piece is in the correct first layer corner position 
but needs to be flipped around. You need to get it out of the 
first layer (ie. into the last layer), and then re-insert it into the 
first layer the correct way around.</p></li>

<!-- MIDDLE LAYER -->

<a name="mid-layer"></a><h4><img src="rubikscubesolution_files/LittleCube.jpg" alt="Rubik's Cube" width="20" align="absmiddle" border="0" height="22"> The Middle Layer</h4>

<p>The middle layer consists of one stage:
</p><ol>
	<li>Insert the 4 middle layer edges (each edge is inserted individually).</li>
	</ol>
<p>You only need to learn one algorithm (plus the mirror algorithm) for 
the second layer. There are many more algs, but let's just learn the 
essential one first.
</p><p>First, locate a middle layer edge that is currently sitting in the last layer. I'm going to use the <font color="#0000FF"><b>blue</b></font>/<font color="#FF0000"><b>red</b></font> edge for this example.

</p><center><table width="80%" cellspacing="10"><tbody><tr>
<td valign="top" width="89">
<p></p><center><img src="rubikscubesolution_files/SecondLayerEdge.jpg" width="89" border="0" height="98"></center></td>
<td valign="middle">
<p> This blue edge cubie in the last layer is the <font color="#0000FF"><b>blue</b></font>/<font color="#FF0000"><b>red</b></font> edge cubie.
</p></td></tr></tbody></table></center>

<p>In this picture, <b>U=white, L=<font color="#FF0000">red</font> and F=<font color="#0000FF">blue</font></b>.
 We can't see the other three faces, but obviously the R face is the one
 opposite the L face, the D face is opposite the U face and the B face 
is opposite the F face.

</p><p>Now, position the <font color="#0000FF"><b>blue</b></font>/<font color="#FF0000"><b>red</b></font> edge piece so that the colour on the side of the cube (<font color="#0000FF"><b>blue</b></font> in this case) lines up with it's centre. Now perform the following algorithm: <b>D L D' L' D' F' D F</b>

</p><p>If the <font color="#0000FF"><b>blue</b></font>/<font color="#FF0000"><b>red</b></font> edge piece was flipped the other way so that the <font color="#0000FF"><b>blue</b></font> was on the bottom rather than the <font color="#FF0000"><b>red</b></font>, you would position the cubie under the <font color="#FF0000"><b>red</b></font> centre and perform the following alg: <b>D' F' D F D L D' L'</b>.
 This is the mirror of the previous algorithm. The axis of symmetry lies
 diagonally across the white face, and along the line which divides the <font color="#0000FF"><b>blue</b></font> face and the <font color="#FF0000"><b>red</b></font> face.</p>
<br>
<table width="100%" border="0">
<tbody><tr>
<td width="70%">
<p><b><i>What if the edge piece is not in the last layer?</i></b></p>
<p>The instructions above assume that the middle layer edge piece you are inserting is sitting somewhere in the last layer.</p>

<p>If some middle edges are in the last layer and some are in the middle
 layer in the wrong spot, always start working with the edge pieces that
 are in the last layer. After you've done this, sometimes (but not too 
often) you'll be left with a middle layer edge piece that's in the 
middle layer but in the wrong spot. In this situation, you can use the 
same middle layer algorithms from above (<b>D L D' L' D' F' D F</b> or <b>D' F' D F D L D' L'</b>)
 to insert another edge piece into the middle layer edge position, 
thereby knocking the middle layer edge piece out of its spot and into 
the last layer. Once you've done this, the middle layer edge piece is in
 the last layer and you can deal with it in the usual way.</p>
<p>There is a short-cut to this problem, but as this is a beginner solution with 
minimal memorisation, I haven't included it here. If you really want to learn 
it, take a look at 
<a href="http://www.cosine-systems.com/cubestation/cs2/index.php?page=3x3x3/cfop/f2l/frdd#f2l1">Case Dd2</a> on Dan Harris' site.</p></td>

the middle layer in the right way.</i></p>

<!-- LAST LAYER -->

<a name="last-layer"></a><h4><img src="rubikscubesolution_files/LittleCube.jpg" alt="Rubik's Cube" width="20" align="absmiddle" border="0" height="22"> The Last Layer</h4>

<p>The last layer ("LL") is done in 4 steps:
</p><ol>
	<li>Orient the edges (2 algs) - i.e. form a cross on the D face.</li>
	<li>Permute the corners (1 alg) - i.e. get the corners in the correct 
position in 3D space (don't worry if they still need to be rotated).</li>
	<li>Orient the corners (1 alg + mirror alg) - i.e. flip the corners.</li>
	<li>Permute the edges (1 alg) - i.e. swap the edges around. The cube should now be solved! :)
	</li>
	</ol>

<p>All last layer algorithms are performed with the cross (i.e. the first layer - 
white side in this example) on the bottom.

<!-- LAST LAYER: EDGE ORIENTATION -->

<p>Once you have completed the first two layers ("F2L"), hold the cube 
so that the white side is on the bottom. The white side will be on the 
bottom for the remainder of the solution. This means that the white side
 is the D side for all last layer algorithms.</p>

<p>On my cube, white is opposite yellow, therefore yellow is the U face 
for all last layer algorithms on my cube. Note that your cube may have a
 different colour opposite white (e.g. blue). Now have a look at your 
last layer, and in particular, look at the last layer face - there are 4
 possible patterns of LL edges that you may see.</p>

</p><p>Unlike with the initial cross (where all the edges must match up 
with the white centre and with the centres on the middle layer), here 
all you need to worry about is getting all the last layer edges matching
 up with the last layer centre. It doesn't matter if the other colour on
 the LL edge piece does not match up with the colour on the middle layer
 centre. Also, ignore the LL corners too. It doesn't matter what they 
are doing at the moment. Now, let's consider each of these LL edge 
states separately.

<p>The two possible states are:</p><ul>
	<li>two adjacent LL corners need to be swapped; or</li>
	<li>two diagonal LL corners need to be swapped.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>These are the only two possible states. If you cannot identify one of these two states with your LL corners then one 
	or more of the following must be true:</p><ul>
	<li>You have not finished the F2L.</li>
	<li>Someone has ripped out a corner of your cube and put it in the wrong way.</li>
	<li>Someone has ripped off some of your stickers and put them back in the 
	wrong place.</li>
	<li>You are not looking hard enough. ;) </li>

<p><b><i>Swapping adjacent corners</i></b>

</p><p>Hold the cube with the white side on the bottom, and the two 
corners to be swapped are in the front right top and the back right top 
positions. Perform the following algorithm: <b>L U' R' U L' U' R U2</b>. 
To see an animated version of this algorithm, see the first algorithm on
<a href="http://lar5.com/cube/fas5.html">Lars Petrus' 

<!-- <p>In a previous version of this page, I had the adjacent corner swap written with the cross on top. This wasn't very good and confused people because all the other LL algs on this page are written for cross on bottom. When I realised this I was just going to delete it, but in case anyone really wants to do the LL adjacent corner swap with cross on top (which I advise against) and was using this page as a reference I decided to leave it in. I may revise this later and remove it altogether. However, for now, here it is: Hold the cube with the white cross on the top, and the two corners to be swapped are in the front right bottom and the back right bottom positions. Perform the following algorithm: <b>L D' R' D L' D' R D2</b> -->

Step 5 page</a>. On Lars' site, the algorithm is being executed from a slightly 
different angle (the two corners being swapped are front-top-right and 
front-top-left), but it is the same exact algorithm.</p><p></p><p>
<b><i>Swapping diagonal corners</i></b>

</p><p>Swapping diagonal corners can be done by executing the adjacent 
corner swap algorithm twice. Perform it once to swap any two LL corners.
 Re-examine you cube and you'll see that now there are just two LL 
corners that need to be swapped. Position it correctly for the final LL 
adjacent corner swap and perform the LL adjacent corner swap algorithm.

</p><p><b><i>States 3-7</i></b></p><p>
Once you know the algorithms for States 1 and 2, you can solve any LL 
orientation State. The remaining States can be oriented using a maximum 
of 2 algorithms. You will need to do one of the following (i) the State 1
 algorithm twice, (ii) the State 2 algorithm twice, (iii) the State 1 
algorithm, then the State 2 algorithm, or (iv) the State 2 algorithm, 
then the State 1 algorithm.

</p><p>In a previous edition of this solution, I had said that I'm not 
going to tell you 
exactly how to combine the State 1 and State 2 algorithms to solve 
States 3-7. 
My reason for this was because it is important that you try to 
understand how the State 1 and the State 2 algorithms work, 
and that once you do understand them you will be able to work out how to
 use them to solve all the States. 
I still believe this, however, I received emails from a few people who 
were having trouble with States 3-7, so I decided to write some extra 
tips. I still suggest that you try to work out States 3-7 by yourself, 
but if you are really stuck, have a look here:

</p><ul>
<li><p>Solve each first layer corner + corresponding middle layer edge 
in one step. This means that after the cross you only have 4 steps (4 
corner/edge pairs) to complete the F2L. With this beginner method there 
are 8 steps: solve each of the 4 first layer corners, then solve each of
 the 4 middle layer edges. I'd suggest just playing around with your 
cube and figuring out the F2L corner/edge pairs yourself. For some hints
 about solving the F2L intuitively, have a look at <a href="http://dougreed.no-ip.org/%7Edoug/f2l/f2l.htm" target="_blank"><b>Doug Reed's intuitive F2L guide</b></a>.

<li><p>Learn the 4 specific algorithms (or rather, 3 algorithms plus one
 mirror algorithm) for each of the 4 different permutation states of the
 LL edges. 
My beginner solution already shows you 2 of the 4 last layer edge 
permutation 
algorithms, the other two last layer edge permutation algorithms are

<p>The method I've documented here is what I believe to be a good 
beginner method. The problem with some beginner methods is that they are
 not scalable - to improve your cubing you have to un-learn much of what
 you know and re-learn it in a different way. This method focuses on 
memorising very few algorithms, but is structured in a way that allows 
for development into an intermediate or advanced method. Other thing I 
should say is that I didn't actually devise any of the last layer 
algorithms in this method. I merely chose a selection of existing 
algorithms (sourced from a variety of places including <a href="http://www.ws.binghamton.edu/fridrich/cube.html" target="_blank"><b>Jessica's site</b></a> and <a href="http://benjerry.middlebury.edu/%7Eknights/CubeInfo.html" target="_blank"><b>Dan K's site</b></a>) and organised them into a simple solution method.
