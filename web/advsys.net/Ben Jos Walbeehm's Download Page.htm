<h2>Programs written by Ben Jos Walbeehm</h2>

Here are a few of the many many things I have written over the (also 
many many) years. The actual things I make available are subject to 
change. Programs (such as <i>BJWFlate</i>,
<i>FixReg</i>, <i>UU.COM</i>, and <i>Win9xNTVer</i>) and webpages (such as my <i>Windows 95 Update Page</i>) I have written that were available in the past may no longer be available now.

<p>Here is the current selection of programs I have written that I have chosen to make publicly available:</p>

<h3>BJWzipFE</h3>

<table border="1">
<tbody><tr><td align="left">&nbsp; Current version &nbsp;</td><td align="center">&nbsp; 1.06 &nbsp;</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">&nbsp; Date &nbsp;</td><td align="center">&nbsp; 20-Nov-2006 &nbsp;</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">&nbsp; Program type &nbsp;</td><td align="center">&nbsp; Win32 command line &nbsp;</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">&nbsp; Download size &nbsp;</td><td align="center">&nbsp; 10,603 bytes &nbsp;</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">&nbsp; Download link &nbsp;</td><td align="center">&nbsp; <a href="http://www.walbeehm.com/download/BJWzipFE106.7z">BJWzipFE106.7z</a> &nbsp;</td></tr>
</tbody></table>

<p><i>BJWzipFE</i> is meant as a front-end for DOS-based packers that 
create files in ZIP-compatible format. Using this front-end, the files 
stored inside the
ZIP file will retain their exact names, including capitalisation, 
including names longer than the 8.3 DOS format, and including names 
containing spaces.
So <i>BJWzipFE</i> adds long filename support to DOS-based ZIP programs.</p>

<p>From a command line, run <i>BJWzipFE</i> without any parameters to get help.</p>

<h3>Calendar</h3>

<table border="1">
<tbody><tr><td align="left">&nbsp; Current version &nbsp;</td><td align="center">&nbsp; 1.3 &nbsp;</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">&nbsp; Date &nbsp;</td><td align="center">&nbsp; 17-May-1993 &nbsp;</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">&nbsp; Program type &nbsp;</td><td align="center">&nbsp; DOS16 command line &nbsp;</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">&nbsp; Download size &nbsp;</td><td align="center">&nbsp; 1,999 bytes &nbsp;</td></tr>

</tbody></table>

<p><i>Calendar</i> performs calculations on dates. I wrote this tiny 
little program (executable size: 2,585 bytes, and half of that is just 
text) entirely in assembly back in 1993 and still use
it every now and then. Despite the fact that it is a 16-bit DOS program,
 it runs perfectly from a command line in Windows 95/98/Me/2000/XP. For a
 given date it will calculate the day of the week,
it calculates the difference in days between two dates, it calculates 
the dates of Easter for a given range of years, it calculates all Friday
 the 13ths for a given range of years, and it calculates
the resulting date when adding/subtracting a number of days to/from a 
given date.</p>

<p>Side note: Back when I wrote this program, it made me suspect that 
every year has at least one and at most three Friday the 13ths, and I 
then quickly came up with an elegant proof of this fact.</p>

<p>From a command line, run <i>Calendar</i> without any parameters to get help. Alternatively, type "type calendar.com". :)</p>

<h3>DeflOpt</h3>

<table border="1">
<tbody><tr><td align="left">&nbsp; Current version &nbsp;</td><td align="center">&nbsp; 2.07 &nbsp;</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">&nbsp; Date &nbsp;</td><td align="center">&nbsp; 05-Sep-2007 &nbsp;</td></tr>

</tbody></table>

<p><i>DeflOpt</i> tries to reduce the size of GZIP (extensions .gz and 
.tgz), PNG, and ZIP files. Regardless of which programs/settings were 
used to create them,
<i>DeflOpt</i> will be able to reduce these files by at least a few bytes more than 95% of the time.</p>

<p>A little bit of history: Back in March of 2003, I finally decided to 
write something I had been wanting to write for many years: My own ZIP 
program. So I wrote a program called
<i>BJWFlate</i>. However, once I had written it, once I had "solved the 
puzzle", I quickly lost interest. Every now and then, I still see people
 looking for <i>BJWFlate</i>. Don't.
At the time, <i>BJWFlate</i> was pretty good in terms making smaller ZIP
 files than other "zippers" did, but now, several years later, even I 
myself might not use it anymore if I
wanted to use the ZIP format and make a ZIP file smaller than what any 
other zippers out there do. Back in the day, <i>BJWFlate</i> could compete with (even custom-compiled versions of)
<a href="http://www.7-zip.org/">7-zip</a> (in its ZIP mode) and <a href="http://advsys.net/ken/utils.htm#kzip">kzip</a>. Since then, kzip has been updated several times and can beat all
other zippers (in terms of smallest resulting size) more than 90% of the time.</p>

<p>If you are very stubborn and <b>still</b> want to get <i>BJWFlate</i>, try the following page on Roman Scherzer's site: <a href="http://www.clrmame.com/download.htm#zipmax">http://www.clrmame.com/download.htm#zipmax</a>.
For historical purposes, as well as because some of the information may still be useful, here is my <a href="http://www.walbeehm.com/download/bjwflate.html">old page</a> on <i>BJWFlate</i> and <i>DeflOpt</i>. Please keep in mind that several
things on that page are outdated and that I have stopped all development on <i>BJWFlate</i>.</p>

<p><i>DeflOpt</i> is just something I wrote while I was developing <i>BJWFlate</i>. I found that one of the ideas I used in <i>BJWFlate</i> was not used by <b>any</b> other zipper.
Even if another zipper could compress a file to a size that was smaller than what <i>BJWFlate</i> did, I could still apply that idea to that other zipper's ZIP file and make it smaller.
So while <i>DeflOpt</i> started its life as just a small piece of code within <i>BJWFlate</i>, it survived while the rest of <i>BJWFlate</i> did not.</p>

<p>I have to give an acknowledgement here: When I started writing <i>BJWFlate</i>, I was stuck at some point in my understanding of the Deflate specification.
A few email exchanges with <a href="http://advsys.net/ken">Ken Silverman</a>, who was working on <a href="http://advsys.net/ken/utils.htm#kzip">kzip</a> at the time,
made me understand the one thing I had not understood about the Deflate specification, and so I wrote <i>BJWFlate</i>. <i>DeflOpt</i> grew from that, as mentioned.</p>

<p>Contrary to what I have seen mentioned on some pages, <i>DeflOpt</i> does <b>not</b> just remove garbage from deflated files, but actually optimises the structures created by deflate
programs and then recodes the files using those optimised structures. It performs a few other tricks too that are <b>not</b>
 "just removing garbage". It will make a file smaller more than
95% of the time, even if that file was created by a deflate program that
 does not generate "garbage", and even if it was created by Ken 
Silverman's kzip or
<a href="http://advsys.net/ken/utils.htm#pngout">pngout</a> programs.

</p><p><i>DeflOpt</i> should be used as the final step in getting files smaller. First use other programs (I recommend kzip for ZIP files and
pngout for PNG files), then run <i>DeflOpt</i> on the resulting files.</p>

<p>I have recently made some modifications that will allow <i>DeflOpt</i> to be compiled using GCC. This means that native executables of <i>DeflOpt</i> could be made for pretty much every
platform. In fact, I already have a native i386 Linux executable of <i>DeflOpt</i>.
 I am just looking for people to test that Linux version. So if you are 
running Linux on an i386-compatible
box, contact me. For those who want a native executable for other 
platforms, contact me too. Read the DeflOpt.txt file for instructions on
 how to contact me.</p>

<p>From a command line, run <i>DeflOpt</i> without any parameters to get help.</p>

<h3>Sorting Demonstration</h3>

<table border="1">
<tbody><tr><td align="left">&nbsp; Current version &nbsp;</td><td align="center">&nbsp; 1.09 &nbsp;</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">&nbsp; Date &nbsp;</td><td align="center">&nbsp; 23-Mar-2004 &nbsp;</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">&nbsp; Program type &nbsp;</td><td align="center">&nbsp; Win32 GUI &nbsp;<br>&nbsp; Requires DirectX 7.0 or higher &nbsp;</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">&nbsp; Download size &nbsp;</td><td align="center">&nbsp; 11,453 bytes &nbsp;</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">&nbsp; Download link &nbsp;</td><td align="center">&nbsp; <a href="http://www.walbeehm.com/download/SortingDemo109.7z">SortingDemo109.7z</a> &nbsp;</td></tr>
</tbody></table>

<p><i>Sorting Demonstration</i> gives a visually attractive 
demonstration of a lot of different sorting algorithms. As a student, 
over 20 years ago, I was pretty much being thrown to
death with sorting algorithms, so I wrote a much simpler similar program
 for the Commodore 64 to actually <b>see</b> all those sorting 
algorithms in action. Then, in 2001, I decided
to write a much nicer looking version for Windows. Over the years since 
then, I have occasionally made additions and improvements to this little
 project.</p>

<p>In the main menu of <i>Sorting Demonstration</i>, use the up and down
 arrow keys to go from item to item, and the left and right arrow keys 
to modify the currently selected item.
If a given algorithm's demonstration takes too long for your taste, hit 
the Escape key and in the main menu, change the number of frames per 
second and/or the number of frames it
actually draws. Note that increasing the scaling factor (which requires a
 restart of <i>Sorting Demonstration</i>) can also be used to make things faster.</p>

<p>Finally note that in most cases, if <i>Sorting Demonstration</i> takes longer for sorting algorithm A than for sorting algorithm B, then this actually also reflects the difference
in efficiencies of those algorithms. There are one or two exceptions, though.</p>

<h3>Zip Manager</h3>

<table border="1">
<tbody><tr><td align="left">&nbsp; Current version &nbsp;</td><td align="center">&nbsp; 1.05 &nbsp;</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">&nbsp; Date &nbsp;</td><td align="center">&nbsp; 20-Nov-2006 &nbsp;</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">&nbsp; Program type &nbsp;</td><td align="center">&nbsp; Win32 GUI &nbsp;</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">&nbsp; Download size &nbsp;</td><td align="center">&nbsp; 18,489 bytes &nbsp;</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">&nbsp; Download link &nbsp;</td><td align="center">&nbsp; <a href="http://www.walbeehm.com/download/ZipMgr105.7z">ZipMgr105.7z</a> &nbsp;</td></tr>
</tbody></table>

<p><i>Zip Manager</i> is a two-pane GUI. Load (or drag) a ZIP file into 
one pane, load a ZIP file into the other pane (or not). Then manipulate 
them. Copy files from one ZIP file to the
other, delete files within a ZIP file, rename them, and some more 
things. All <b>without</b> recompression. For people who remember Norton
 Commander, this program should feel very intuitive.
But even for those who don't know Norton Commander, just being able to 
drag &amp; drop, copy things back and forth, delete, rename, and so on 
makes this a very valuable utility.</p>

<h3>Rubik's Cube solvers</h3>

<p>Finally, I'd like mention something else I have written: Ken Silverman's <a href="http://advsys.net/ken/download.htm?#rubix">Rubix</a>.
 Ken wrote all the code for displaying cubes, making
turns, animations, sounds, and so on. I, Ben Jos Walbeehm, wrote the 
solvers that are now integrated into Rubix. I wrote 3 different solvers 
from scratch. That means I did not borrow anyone's
ideas. I developed everything on my own. Writing a (3x3x3) Rubik's Cube 
solver was something I had been wanting to do for more than 20 years. 
When I finally started on it, I found that I had a
need for displaying the actual cube and the results of the turns my 
program made. Not wanting to spend a lot of time writing code to display
 the cube, I browsed the web and found Ken's Rubix
program. I contacted Ken and since he was very interested in integrating
 my solver into Rubix, he sent me the source code for it. That made 
writing my solvers a lot easier and I kept sending
Ken updates of my solvers and making suggestions to him to make Rubix 
even better.</p>

<p>Once I had finished the 3x3x3 solver, Rubix could solve 3x3x3 cubes 
as well as the trivial 1x1x1 cubes. I did not like that "hole" between 
the 1x1x1 and 3x3x3 and browsing the web a little
taught me that the 2x2x2 could always be solved in at most 11 turns. It 
took me only 2 days to write an optimal 2x2x2 solver, one that uses 
brute force to find an optimal solution for any given
situation in a fraction of a second.</p>


<p>Around 20 years ago, after having manually solved 4x4x4 and 5x5x5 
cubes, I realised that I understood enough about the cube that I could 
solve cubes of any size. So when my 2x2x2 solver for
Rubix was finished, I finally decided to put that knowledge into source 
code and so I wrote another solver for Rubix, one that can solve any 
NxNxN cube for N &gt;= 4. So Rubix currently contains
3 different solvers written by me. In chronological order: (1) A "pretty
 good" 3x3x3 solver. (2) An optimal 2x2x2 solver. (3) A solver that 
solves <b>any</b> NxNxN cube for N &gt;= 4. It can solve
4x4x4, 5x5x5, 10x10x10, 64x64x64, ... cubes. Although Rubix has an upper
 limit now of 64x64x64, this can be trivially increased. I have used my 
own code to solve 160x160x160 cubes.</p>

<h3>Contacting me</h3>

<p>Since I receive well over one hundred spam emails every day, my own <i>SpamKill</i> program uses very aggressive settings. So unless you are on my "safe list" or follow the instructions
I have given in <i>DeflOpt.txt</i>, I may never see your email. So read <i>DeflOpt.txt</i> and follow its instructions when contacting me. Even if it is not about <i>DeflOpt</i>. ;)</p>

Ken is not only one of the best programmers in the world (not just my 
opinion, but the opinion of a lot of other(?) experts too), but also
unafraid to share his source code with people he respects.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.textpad.com/">TextPad</a>. A text editor. I am a
 registered user of TextPad and have been using this text editor for 
MANY years. My favourite text editor. And not just for text files.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you feel you should be linked here as well, do not hesitate to 
contact me. I am sorry that I made contacting me a bit hard, but the
